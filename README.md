# SamplerManipulation (WIP)
 Simple and fast audio sample manipulation.

 It could be use as a sound design tool/instrument.

 - Simple drag and drop of samples.
 - Time streaching capabilities using groove~ object.
 - Sweep and select section of the audio sample.

 ## TODO

 - Real-time processing using a live input (mic signal or instrument signal)
 - FFT processing and processing selection.
 - Implement a good reverb sent.
